    This is an idea by taken by a tsoding session where the main idea is try to implement an spredsheet
    in terminal, the program gotta have the basic functions of a real one like arithmetic operations and
    conditionals (i guess?); in this case it got both however it does not support stats functions and it
    just accepts integer numbers defintion (rational numbers can be obtained by arith ops [but it isnt the idea]).

    The syntax is pretty simple, every cell is defined by '|' and all the tokens found will be saved into
    such cell until a new '|' is found, every cell got expressions and such expressions also can have
    sub expressions, so a cell can look like
    | $3 + 1 - {$4 - {?2 == 2 1 8}}

    and it will be solved as
    | 3 + 1 - 4 - 1 -> | -1

    so to make sub-expressions put { and the type of expression to be solved $ for maths and ?
    for conditionals, the examples are in the 'syntaxis' folder and some tiny programs are in the
    'programs' folder.

    issues.

    Do not know why it gets crazy when the content got more than 5000 lines, i mean it is able to perform all
    the ops but then breaks itself saying it does not know about token '' and its code is -32, like wtf?
